This endorheic lake is 12 kilometres long and extends from India to Tibet, with two-thirds of it lying in the latter. Owing to its altitude, the Pangong Lake temperature ranges from -5°C to 10°C as a result of which it freezes completely during winters in spite of its salinity.</td>

            <td>Nestled in a remote corner of Ladakh, the Zanskar Valley is one of the most enchanting places to visit. It is located in the eastern corner of Jammu and Kashmir and is separated from Ladakh by the Zanskar Mountain Range. It is a part of The Tethys Himalayas which is formed with weekly transformed sedimentary series. Zanskar Valley is known for its wide views and sceneries, cave monasteries and mostly travelled to for its trekking trails and river rafting experiences and the Suru Valley, the two valleys almost always visited together.Nestled between two tiny alpine lakes, most isolated of all Himalayan valleys, Zanskar Valley has an area of about 5,000 sq kms and is situated at an elevation of 13,154 above sea level. This valley is cut off from the rest of the world for over 9 months of the year because of heavy snowfall in the region. Due to the distinct flora and fauna and the extremely variant climate, Zanskar Valley has become one of the most sought after places to visit. With a backdrop of the beautiful snow-capped glacier mountain peaks and the crystal clear water gushing down the valley, it has gained even more popularity.
